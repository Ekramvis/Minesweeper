Minesweeper - App Academy Learning Project
==========================================

A console-based minesweeper game. 

###Learning Objectives
0. Use breadth-first search to reveal portions of the board after selection
0. Save games and high scores with YAML
0. Practice object oriented programming techniques

###How to play
Simply load the "minesweeper.rb" file and a new game will launch. There is a simple UI that allows you to create new game, load a saved game, check high scores, and quit the program. Only one game can be saved at a time. When playing, use a grid system to pick squares and an action: flag (f), reveal (r), unflag (u) to make a move. The timer updates every turn.
